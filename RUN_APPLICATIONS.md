# Ready to Run Applications!

## Once Database Setup is Complete:

### Backend Server (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Expected output:
- Server will start on port 3005
- Should see "Church Management Backend API running on port 3005"

### Frontend Application (Terminal 2)  
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Expected output:
- Next.js will start on port 3000
- Should see "Local: http://localhost:3000"

## Access Points:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3005
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:3005/api-docs (if available)

## What to Expect:
- Frontend will load the Church Management System interface
- Backend will provide API endpoints for data operations
- Both will connect to your Supabase database

Let me know when database setup is done and I'll run these commands!
